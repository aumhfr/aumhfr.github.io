<h2 style="margin-top: 12px">The Speed Star, IJN <i>Ayanami</i></h2>
<p>
  The Japanese destroyer <i>Ayanami</i> was the eleventh of twenty-four <i>Fubuki-</i>class destroyers and the first of the <i>Ayanami</i> subclass. Under the restrictions of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which prevented Japan from competing with the West's capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy developed a greater number of ships that were less likely to fall under the limitations of the Treaty, such as destroyers and cruisers. By the time the <i>Fubuki-</i>class destroyers launched in the mid-1920s and 30s, they were considered to have set new standards in speed and armaments for destroyers that would go mostly unmatched over the span of World War II. The <i>Ayanami-</i>class was the second of three subclasses making up the <i>Fubuki-class.</i> Built in the early 1930s, <i>Ayanami</i> sported a few changes, such as a range finding tower and "Type B" turrets that could be elevated almost completely vertically for anti-aircraft use. <i>Ayanami</i> herself was laid down on 20 January, 1928 under the designation "Destroyer No. 45," as the <i>Fubuki-</i>class destroyers were only originally intended to have hull numbers. This proved to be a source of confusion, however, and <i>Ayanami</i> inhereted her namesake on 1 August, 1929, before finally being commissioned on 30 April, 1930.

<h2 style="margin-top: 12px"><i>Ayanami's</i> Operational History</h2>
<p>
  The decade between 1930 and 1940 proved to be uneventful for <i>Ayanami,</i> without her seeing any action during the midst of the early portions of the <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="A military conflict between Imperial Japan and the Chinese Republic between 1937 and 1945. Made up the Chinese Theater portion of the greater Pacific Theater.">Second Sino-Japanese War</i>. In 1937, she would cover Japanese forces as they landed at Shanghai and Hangzhou, China. She would repeat a similar task in 1940 during the Japanese invasion of southern China, but it wouldn't be until World War II that <i>Ayanami</i> got a chance to see her share of significant conflict. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, <i>Ayanami</i> was assigned to Destroyer Division 19 alongside her sisters <i>Isonami, Shikiname,</i> and <i>Uranami.</i> On 19 December, 1941, <i>Ayanami, Uranami,</i> and <i>Yugiri,</i> another <i>Fubuki-</i>class, engaged the Royal Netherlands submarine <i>O 20</i> off Khota Baru, Malaysia. After being forced to submerge, <i>O 20</i> was bombarded with Japanese <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="A barrel-like container packed with an explosive, used as an anti-submarine weapon.">depth charges</i> while attempting to flee at full speed, and was eventually struck by one of <i>Ayanami's</i> torpedoes, sinking her. <i>Ayanami</i> also subsequently took part in "Operation L," the assault on the Dutch East Indies by Imperial Japan, but was forced to return to a bay in southeast Vietnam for emergency repairs after striking a reef in the Anambas. 
</p>
<p>
  Between 4-5 June, 1942, <i>Ayanami</i> participated in the Battle of Midway, one of the most devastating Japanese defeats of the Pacific Theater and what is viewed by some as the turning point for the War in the Pacific. As part of <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto was the commander-in-chief of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet.">Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's</i> main fleet, <i>Ayanami</i> voyaged a route spanning the Amami archipelago, Taiwan, Singapore, and Indonesia for a planned second Indian Ocean raid, but the raid was cancelled in favor of the Guadalcanal Campaign. <i>Ayanami</i> was ordered to Truk, arriving in late August. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons spanning from 24 to 25 August, <i>Ayanami</i> served as a supply escort and a ferry for troops. In mid-November, <i>Ayanami</i> took part in the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, where she was attached to a scouting force assigned to sweep for enemy vessels.

<h2>End of <i>Ayanami</i></h2>
<p>
  When the American Task Force 64 was spotted near Savo Island, <i>Ayanami</i> was detached from the rest of her scouting force for lower risk of the backbone of the Japanese force being ambushed and for more efficient scouting. When the American ships were spotted, <i>Ayanami</i> was one of the three ships positioned to engage them alongside the light cruisers <i>Sendai</i> and <i>Nagara.</i> <i>Ayanami</i> herself was spotted by the American destroyer <i>Walke,</i> but <i>Nagara</i> provided a more enticing target for the American destroyer group. Perhaps they overtaxed their own strength: torpedoes and shells from <i>Ayanami, Uranami,</i> and <i>Nagara</i> sank two of the enemy destroyers while severely damaging two more, one of which would be scuttled later. The first phase of the battle was a Japanese victory, but the American fleet had <i>Ayanami's</i> number. With her position revealed after attacking the American destroyers, <i>Ayanami</i> thereafter voyaged just a bit too close to the battleship <i>Washington.</i> The dreadnought shelled her, inflicting crippling damage and ensuring that she would need to be scuttled a few hours later.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Ayanami</i> was sunk at what would later be named "Ironbottom Sound," a stretch of water between the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands. Dozens of ships and planes rest on the seafloor, forming a layer of iron. In July of 1992, marine archeologist Robert Ballard led an expedition at Ironbottom Sound, discovering the wreck of the <i>Ayanami</i> among others. The hull and keel of the ship were destroyed from the scuttling, with the ship resting in two pieces: the stern remains upright while the twisted bow lays on its starboard side. Just barely, one can still make out part of her name. <i class="btip tip-top" data-tip="This part confuses me a little bit. In the above images, the Fubuki-class destroyers have their names written in the Katakana set of Japanese characters, whereas „ÅÇ is a Hiragana character. It's hard to see, but I think the picture in the Ayanami wreck showcasing the „ÅÇ is of her stern, so I assume the Fubuki-class had the first character of their names written on their stern in Hiragana.">One "„ÅÇ" remains clear: the character "A" in <i><b>A</b>yanami</i></i>.
