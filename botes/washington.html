<h2 style="margin-top: 12px">Maritime Kingfisher: <i>Washington</i> BB-56</h2>
<p>USS <i>Washington</i> was the second of two sisters making up the <i>North Carolina-</i>class of fast battleships. She was laid down at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on the fourteenth of June, 1938 and was launched two years later on the first of June, 1940. Despite the United States' initial neutrality during the start of World War II, <i>Washington</i> still had frequent training sorties with her sister, <i>North Carolina</i>, and the aircraft carrier <i>Wasp</i> before America entered the war in late 1941. <i>North Carolina</i> and <i>Washington</i> were subsequently assigned to the Atlantic Fleet as <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="Battleship Division 6">BatDiv 6</i>.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 12px"><i>Washington</i> at War</h2>
<p>
  In March of 1942, <i>Washington</i> was assigned as the flagship of Task Force 39, leading <i>Wasp </i> and the two heavy cruisers <i>Wichita</i> and <i>Tuscaloosa</i> to Britain with the purpose of reinforcing the <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="The Home Fleet was a Royal Navy fleet tasked with operations taking part in Great Britain's territorial waters.">British Home Fleet</i> in Scapa Flow. On March 27, Admiral Wilcox was swept overboard during the traversal of heavy seas. Because of the inclement weather near Sable Island, Wilcox drowned before he could be recovered and Rear Admiral Robert C. Giffen from <i>Wichita</i> assumed command of Task Force 39 until their arrival at Scapa Flow on the fifth of April. A few weeks later, Task Force 39 was reestablished as Task Force 99 with <i>Washington</i> once again taking the role of flagship. Task Force 99's first operation was to sweep waters near Seidesfjord, Iceland, to guarantee safe passage for a supply convoy. Due to an <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="Due to foggy conditions, Punjabi was rammed by the battleship HMS King George V.">accident</i> resulting in the sinking of the destroyer HMS <i>Punjabi, Washington</i> took some damage from the destroyer's <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="A barrel-like container packed with an explosive, used as an anti-submarine weapon.">depth charges</i>, but stayed at sea until the fifteenth of May before returning to Scapa Flow. <i>Washington</i> continued to provide support for the Royal Navy until mid-July, when she returned to United States waters for an overhaul at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
  On the 14 November, <i>Washington</i>, now serving as the flagship of Rear Admiral Willis Lee and under Task Force 64, prepared to engage with a Japanese bombardment group led by Admiral Nobutake Kondō consisting of the battleship <i>Kirishima</i>, cruisers <i>Takao</i> and <i>Atago</i>, and a screen of destroyers at Guadalcanal. Late that night, <i>Washington</i> picked up a cruiser and a destroyer sent as a scouting party before opening fire on the Japanese force with her sexy 16-inch main guns. After illuminating the targets with <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="Explosive projectiles shot up into the air before bursting; a type of flare.">star shells</i> with assistance from the battleship <i>South Dakota,</i> <i>Washington</i> was fired upon by the Japanese destroyer <i>Ayanami</i> before she was subsequently shelled by <i>Washington</i> and crippled instantly.
</p>
<p>
  Following the destruction of the <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="Imperial Japanese Navy">IJN</i> <i>Ayanami</i>, the rest of the Japanese fleet opened fire on <i>South Dakota</i>, allowing <i>Washington</i> to barrage them without worry of direct retaliation. She engaged with <i>Kirishima</i>, this conflict being the only one-on-one battleship strife in the entire war, and crippled her before turning to <i>Atago</i> and <i>Takao</i> to halt their advance. Admiral Kondō ordered his destroyers to advance by launching torpedoes, forcing <i>Washington</i> to retreat and evade. After trying to reestablish contact with <i>Kirishima</i>, however, the ship was discovered crippled, flooding, and ablaze due to <i>Washington</i>'s earlier attack. She sank shortly after. With the sun beginning to rise, the Task Force's objective of delaying Japanese troop transports was a success, allowing Allied artillery and aircraft to barrage them before they could land at Henderson Field with troop transports under the cover of night.<br><br>

<p>Over the course of the next couple of years, <i>Washington</i> took part in a number of operations and took the role of flagship for a variety of Task Forces, resulting in the promotion of the now-Vice Admiral Lee. On 25 October, 1944, she fought in the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battleship-to-battleship action to date, although she didn't play a very significant part in the Allies' victory. In late March, 1945, <i>Washington</i>, now a member of Task Group 58.2, assaulted the Okinawa island to lower defenses before the Allied invasion. During this time, a concert of <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="A suicide bombing tactic employed by Japanese aviators in which they would crash their planes into Allied ships."><i>kamikaze</i></i> attacks in tandem with a desperate assault from the Japanese battleship <i>Yamato</i> attempted to delay the Allied fleet, but <i>Washington</i> emerged unscathed with the help of allied aircraft. She once again provided artillery support on 19 April during the invasion, remaining at Okinawa until the end of May, before being dispatched back to the city of Bremerton, Washington for a refit. This enhancement would prove unnecessary, however, as the end of the War was drawing near.</p>
  <h2>End of <i>Washington</i></h2>
<p>
  With the War long over by the time she completed her refit in September, <i>Washington</i> arrived at the Panama Canal to participate in <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="27 October, in reference to the 26th President Theodore Roosevelt's birthday; Roosevelt was a navy enthusiast and former assistant Secretary of the Navy.">Navy Day</i> celebrations before being modified at a Philadelphia shipyard to be able to carry additional personnel so that she could participate in <i class="qtip tip-top" data-tip="A ferry system with the goal of bringing over eight million American servicement overseas back home.">Operation Magic Carpet</i>. Without the need for gun crews, Washington embarked for Southampton, Britain, embarking 185 officers and 1,479 enlisted men and bringing them back to New York. Here, she would be decommissioned on 27 June, 1947 and would remain a part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet throughout the 1950s. Although the Navy considered modernizing <i>Washington</i> and <i>North Carolina</i> in the mid-50s, the total cost was deemed too expensive, with an estimate of $40 million per ship, and the project was abandoned. On 24 May, 1961, <i>Washington</i> was <i class="qtip tip-top" style="color:black;border-bottom:0" data-tip=":(">sold for scrap</i> and broken up by the Lipsett Division of Luria Brothers. <i>Washington</i> BB-56 earned 13 battle stars over the course of the war. The legacy of the <i>North Carolina-</i>class still burns strong, however, as <i>North Carolina</i> BB-55 herself still remains in Wilmington, North Carolina as a battleship memorial. With her sister serving as a reminder of the past, the ardent passion of <i>Washington's</i> fire has never completely extinguished.
